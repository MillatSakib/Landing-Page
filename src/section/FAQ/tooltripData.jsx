        Landwind is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software
        so everything you see in the library has a design equivalent in our
        Figma file.

    title: "What are the differences between Landwind and Tailwind UI?",
    description: (
      <>
        The main difference is that the core components from Landwind are open
        source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product.
        Another difference is that Landwind relies on smaller and standalone
        components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          However, we actually recommend using both Landwind, Landwind Pro, and
          even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason stopping you from
          using the best of two worlds.
